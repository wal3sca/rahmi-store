      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        RahMi is a wellness space in Harlem, New York which honors Indigenous
        healing practices, including those of African and Indigenous roots. We
        find importance in expanding these healing modalities to culturally
        aligned, under-resourced, low-income communities. This space works with
        trained and experienced professionals of Eastern and Western practices.
